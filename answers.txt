1. I'm taking this course because I need to better find insights about my data.
I'm a physics graduate student, but my interests are primarely in financial
algorithms. The data is pretty complex and multidimensional, and good visualizations
are required to gain insights about how or if the algorithm is working.

2. I think I will learn how to better visualize my datasets and more quickly
and efficiently extract insights.

3. I have extensive Python experience, moderate C#/C++, and some C/VHDL/BASIC/random.

4. I am most confortable with Python.

5. I have created numerous heatmaps of aspects of my financial algorithm.

6. My financial algorithm frequently generates datasets ~20GB. I use a homebuilt
server to handle the largest datasets in memory, and failing that, I use HDF5 files
to only partially load what I need. Numpy and Pandas takes care of manipulation.

7. I saw some color-coded data on a geographic map related to global agriculture, but
then I saw that animated size-coded scatterplot last class...wow.

8. I really dislike overly crowded scatterplots. They hide a lot and are lazy. I also
really dislike mysterious axes.

9. I'm not a computer science person (physics), so I imagine 70% have better skills.

10. I think my math skills are probably better than 80% of the class.

11. Today I found out github automates what I manually have done for years, so no.
Testing 1,2,3.......

12. Today only.

13. Today only.

14. At the end of last quarter, I learned about markov processes. Nearly everything
can be described as a markov process, if its next state only depends on its current state.
That's nearly everything. Holy crap.
